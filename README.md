# Math Munchers Game

A modern educational math game inspired by the classic "Number Munchers", built with TypeScript, Bun, and the ECSpresso ECS library.

## 🎮 Game Features

- **Grid-based Movement**: Classic Number Munchers gameplay with WASD/Arrow key controls
- **AI Enemies**: Four different enemy behaviors (chase, patrol, random, guard)
- **Math Problem Generation**: Dynamic problems with configurable difficulty levels
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Automatic difficulty scaling based on player performance
- **Professional UI**: Modern, responsive interface with accessibility support
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in FPS tracking and optimization
- **High Score Persistence**: Local storage for high scores

## 🏗️ Architecture

### ECS (Entity Component System)
- **ECSpresso Library**: Modern ECS implementation for game logic
- **Component-based Design**: Modular entity composition
- **System Priorities**: Optimized execution order for performance

### Core Systems
- **Input System** (Priority 100): Handles player input
- **Movement System** (Priority 90): Processes entity movement
- **AI System** (Priority 85): Manages enemy behaviors
- **Collision System** (Priority 70): Detects and handles collisions
- **UI System** (Priority 50): Updates user interface
- **Problem Management** (Priority 30): Spawns and manages math problems
- **Render System** (Priority 10): Handles canvas rendering

### Key Components
- **Position**: Entity coordinates
- **Renderable**: Visual representation
- **Player**: Player-specific data (score, lives, input state)
- **Enemy**: AI behavior configuration
- **MathProblem**: Problem data and correctness
- **Collider**: Collision detection bounds
- **Health**: Life and invulnerability system

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Bun 1.3 or higher

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd math

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server
bun run dev

# Build for production
bun run build

# Preview production build
bun run preview
```

## 🎯 Gameplay

1. **Navigate** the grid using WASD or Arrow keys
2. **Collect** green squares (correct answers) to increase your score
3. **Avoid** red enemies that patrol the grid
4. **Survive** as long as possible while answering math problems
5. **Progress** through difficulty levels as your score increases

### Controls
- **WASD** or **Arrow Keys**: Move player
- **ESC**: Pause/Resume game
- **F1**: Open settings

```

### Configuration
Game settings can be modified in `src/game/config.ts`:
- Grid dimensions
- Entity sizes and colors
- Game mechanics (lives, scoring)
- Performance settings

### Adding New Features
1. **Components**: Define in `src/ecs/Engine.ts` interface
2. **Systems**: Create in `src/ecs/systems/` directory
3. **Entities**: Use `EntityFactory` for consistent creation
4. **UI**: Modify `UIManager.ts` or create new UI components

## 🎨 Customization

### Visual Themes
Modify colors and styling in:
- `src/game/UIConstants.ts` - UI color scheme
- `src/game/config.ts` - Entity colors
- `src/style.css` - CSS custom properties

### Game Balance
Adjust difficulty in:
- `src/game/config.ts` - Core game settings
- `src/game/MathProblemGenerator.ts` - Problem difficulty
- `src/ecs/systems/AISystem.ts` - Enemy behavior

## 📊 Performance

The game includes built-in performance monitoring:
- **FPS Tracking**: Real-time frame rate monitoring
- **System Timing**: Execution time for each system
- **Entity Counting**: Memory usage tracking
- **Performance Warnings**: Automatic detection of performance issues

Access performance data via the browser console or the `PerformanceMonitor` class.

## 🧪 Testing
