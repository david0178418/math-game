I'll update the project plan to include specific library selections and more detailed technical specifications. Let me enhance the document with these details.

---



---

Now let me update the Development Phases section to include more specific technical details about implementation:

---



---

Now let me update the remaining development phases with more specific technical details:

---



---

Now let me add a new section with specific dependency information and update the Resources Required section:

---



---

Finally, let me update the Mitigation Strategies section to include more specific technical approaches:

---



---

Perfect! I've successfully updated the project plan with comprehensive technical specifications. Here's a summary of the major enhancements I've added:

## Key Updates Made:

### 1. **Detailed Technology Stack**
- **Build Tools**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Audio**: Howler.js for cross-browser audio support
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E testing
- **PWA**: Workbox for offline capabilities
- **Deployment**: Multiple CDN options with CI/CD pipeline

### 2. **Comprehensive Development Phases**
Expanded from basic bullet points to 10 detailed phases:
- Project setup with specific commands and file structure
- Core game engine with rendering optimizations
- Input handling with multi-device support
- AI implementation with pathfinding algorithms
- UI/UX with accessibility features
- Audio/visual polish with particle systems
- Testing strategy with both automated and manual testing
- PWA implementation for offline play
- Performance optimization techniques
- Deployment and distribution pipeline

### 3. **Specific Package Dependencies**
- Production dependencies (Howler.js, Workbox)
- Development dependencies (TypeScript, ESLint, testing tools)
- Optional enhancement libraries (GSAP, Konva.js)

### 4. **Enhanced Resource Requirements**
- Specific technical skills needed
- Infrastructure requirements
- Asset specifications with formats and sources
- Team composition recommendations

### 5. **Detailed Mitigation Strategies**
- Performance optimization techniques (object pooling, dirty rendering)
- Accessibility and cross-device compatibility
- Educational value and content generation strategies

The updated plan now provides a clear roadmap for building a professional-quality Number Munchers clone with modern web technologies, comprehensive testing, and production-ready deployment strategies.
